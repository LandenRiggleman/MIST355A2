                Learn about the impact of weather on aviation. Weather conditions play a crucial role in the safety and efficiency of air travel.
                Discovering how much this can effect aviation is looking at the jet stream winds

            <p>
                Jet Stream winds refer to the dominant and consistent directional winds that commonly occur in a particular region over an extended period. 
                These winds are influenced by a combination of factors such as the Earth's rotation, the distribution of land and water, and the uneven heating of the Earth's surface by the sun. 
                Understanding Jet streams is crucial in various fields, including meteorology, aviation, and climate science. But here we look at avaiation

            </p>
            These winds in aviation are so powerful that airlines will plan routes based off of these patterns in order to speed up routes, or avoid slower routes.
